This project is called Scrimmage, and is a multiplayer turn-based startegy game for two people to do battle, with hopes that one stays with units.

Technologies:
  * Unity
  * Unity Netcode for Multiplayer
  * Unity UI Toolkit for UI
  * C# for code

It is a project mostly for my learning, so it might not be the most fleshed out.
